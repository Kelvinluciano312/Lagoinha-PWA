              <h2>A Church of Grace, Growth and Glory</h2>

                <p>
                The Lagoinha church is a charismatic evangelical Baptist church, 
                founded in 1957 by pastor José Rego do Nascimento in the Lagoinha neighborhood, 
                in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais. It was the sixth Baptist church in the capital 
                of Minas Gerais and received this name because of the lake that existed in the 
                region
                </p>

                <p>
                In 1972, pastor Márcio Valadão took over the leadership of the church, 
                which at the time had about 300 members. Under his direction,
                the church grew and expanded, creating various ministries, social projects, 
                radio and TV stations, and branches in other cities and countries
                </p>

                <p> 
                One of the most well-known ministries of Lagoinha is Diante do Trono,
                formed in 1997 as a group of praise and worship. Diante do Trono 
                became one of the largest gospel music ministries in Brazil and the world, 
                recording several albums, DVDs and books, and performing shows and events 
                in various places. The group also has a missionary work, especially in India, 
                where it maintains a home for girls rescued from prostitution
                </p>

                <p>
                In 2020, pastor Márcio Valadão retired and passed the position of senior pastor
                to his son André Valadão,who had been the pastor of the Lagoinha branch in 
                Orlando, Florida, since 2017. The Lagoinha church then decided to transfer 
                its main headquarters to Orlando, where it has attracted many faithful, 
                mainly Brazilians who live in the United States
                </p>

                <p>
                The Lagoinha church is a church that has a history of faith,
                love and service, that has brought the word of God to millions of people,
                and that has adapted to the new times and challenges.
                It is a church that seeks to be a blessing to the world.    
                </p>

                <p>
                Now, we are excited to announce that the Lagoinha church has arrived in Connecticut,
                thanks to the vision and dedication of Pastor Ruiter Fernandes, 
                who planted the first Lagoinha church in the state, in Trumbull. 
                We invite you to join us and be part of our community, 
                where you will find a warm and welcoming atmosphere, 
                a vibrant and passionate worship, and a powerful and relevant message. 
                Come and experience the grace and love of God with us, 
                and discover the purpose and destiny that He has for your life.
                </p>
